# Cloning Netflix using Springboot and React 

##Here, I have cloned Netflix using Springboot, React and MongoDB lets understand why ?

1. I wanted to showcase my skills, I have used Springboot because I wanted to use the best coding practices and wanted to implement the solid 
2. design principles and Aspect Oriented Programming. As I have used for handling Exceptions I know it is not core AOP but springboot have a wrapper on
3. it. I have followed the Single Responsibilty Principle and also the Interface Segregation principle.

2. I have used React here because it is simple one page frontend. I took help in designing the frontend.

3. I have used mongodb here because i dont see much relationship here. In my previous projects in live_coding_cart_service I have used relational
4. database but here I did not because not to much relationships and scrumbled data.
