# Cloning Netflix using Springboot, React and MongoDB. 

## Here, I have cloned Netflix using Springboot, React and MongoDB lets understand why ?

1. I wanted to showcase my skills, I have used Springboot because I wanted to use the best coding practices and made it as **loosely coupled** as possible and wanted to implement the solid design principles and Aspect Oriented Programming. As I have used for handling Exceptions I know it is not core AOP but springboot have a wrapper on it. I have followed the Single Responsibilty Principle and also the Interface Segregation principle.

2. I have used React here because it is simple one page frontend. I took help in designing the frontend.

3. I have used mongodb here because i dont see much relationship here. In my previous projects in live_coding_cart_service I have used relational
4. database but here I did not because not to much relationships and scrumbled data.

## I have gave my reasons to use these tech-stacks now let see the documentation

1. Backend is will run on the port 7777 and I have removed my mongodb cluster db string in your your case create it and paste on the demo one

2. Run it on any IDE (I prefer IntelliJ even It will run on VScode).

3. Swagger UI is used so when it will run on port 7777 the swagger api documentation will be available. For your I am pasting the link :- http://localhost:7777/swagger-ui.html#

4. Exception Handled using wrapper of springboot AOP @ControllerAdvice for exceptions.

## How to make the frontend run

1. You need to type **yarn install**.

2. After that **yarn start**.
